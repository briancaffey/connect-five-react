#Gomoku // Connect 5

## Objective

The first player to connect 5 or more stones either horizontally, vertically of diagonally wins.

## React

This is a simple game I made to get familiar with some React and ES6 fundamentals. I wrote this after watching a tutorial and reading a little bit about how React works. It will be interesting to compare what I did here with the official Facebook React intro tutorial which builds a tic-tac-toe game.

## Try it out

I plan on publishing this to my Github pages website, but until then you can try it out on your local machine. Navigate to a folder where you want this code to live and run the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/briancaffey/connect-five-react.git
$ cd connect-five-react
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
